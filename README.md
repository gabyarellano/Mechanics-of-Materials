# **VIRTUAL LAB :**    1st year Mechanics - the 3-Force Body Case Study

# DEMO description


In this **VIRTUAL LAB** we explore a quadrilateral steel plate acted on by two string tensions **F1**, **F2**, and its weight **W**.  The points of application of these three forces are at the centres of the holes A and B and at the body’s centre of mass G, as shown in the Figure below. The system is planar, that is all forces lie in one plane.

The objective of this experiment is to:



   -  Show that when a body is in equilibrium the **vector sum of the forces must always add to zero**; 
   -  Establish a relationship between the lines of actions of the forces acting on a 3-force body.

There are 3 tasks that need to be completed in this Lab.  Each task has it's dedicated script file(see above)



   1.  **TASK_01** :   We'll define numeric values for our experimental setup system (e.g.:  the mass of the steel plate, the spring stiffness, etc) 
   1.  **TASK_02** :   We'll open and run a simulation of our experimental setup - we'll actually LOG time series data from the simulation. 
   1.  **TASK_03** :   We'll analyse the logged simulation data and use it to confirm the Force equillibrium of the plate

   -  A video file is provided which gives a quick overview of the "cause and effect" workflow.
