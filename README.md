# DEMO description


In this **VIRTUAL LAB** we explore a quadrilateral steel plate acted on by two string tensions **F1**, **F2**, and its weight **W**.  The points of application of these three forces are at the centres of the holes A and B and at the bodyâ€™s centre of mass G, as shown in the Figure below. The system is planar, that is all forces lie in one plane.

The objective of this experiment is to:



   -  Show that when a body is in equilibrium the **vector sum of the forces must always add to zero**; 
   -  Establish a relationship between the lines of actions of the forces acting on a 3-force body.

There are 3 tasks that need to be completed in this Lab.  Each task has it's dedicated script file(see above)



   1.  **TASK_01** :   We'll define numeric values for our experimental setup system (e.g.:  the mass of the steel plate, the spring stiffness, etc) 
   1.  **TASK_02** :   We'll open and run a simulation of our experimental setup - we'll actually LOG time series data from the simulation. 
   1.  **TASK_03** :   We'll analyse the logged simulation data and use it to confirm the Force equillibrium of the plate
